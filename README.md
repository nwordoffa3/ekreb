## Introduction
This project serves as my submission for the Change++ coding challenge. The game prompts the user with a scrambled word, and the user has to guess the original, unscrambled dictionary word. After playing multiple rounds, the user's accuracy is displayed. The project consists of two parts: a frontend and a backend.
